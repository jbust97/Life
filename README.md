# Life
A game of life simulator made with processing.

Instructions.

Use the left button of your mouse to set a cell as alive or dead.
Start and pause the simulation with the enter key.
When in the edition phase, press E on your keyboard to set all cells as dead.


So far the simulation is bounded in code i.e It wont simulate correctly what happens when cells move out of the bound defined in code.
